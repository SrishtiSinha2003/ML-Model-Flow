## Project Overview
<br>
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model step-by-step, from data preprocessing to model deployment. 
<br>The code includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, training, evaluation, and deployment of the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `flask` (for deployment)
  - `joblib` or `pickle` (for model serialization)
